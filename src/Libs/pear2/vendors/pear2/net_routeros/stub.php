Note that due to known issues with PHP itself, encrypted connections may be

Client::sendSync() and/or Client::completeRequest() and/or Client::loop()
without a timeout").

         (compiled into PHP by default) and/or the
         stream_resolve_include_path() function (available since PHP 5.3.2).

Composer), you can also use the console through the "roscon" executable file.
