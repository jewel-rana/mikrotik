* Wincache and APC now check their requirements in greater detail:
    - APC checks if it's enabled by the apc.enabled INI setting.
    - Wincache checks if the user cache is enabled by wincache.ucenabled INI setting.
    - Both check if the SAPI is CLI, and if so, whether that's allowed by the respective ini setting.
* The PHAR stub also checks and reports the above.
* SHM::getIterator() now returns ArrayObject instead of a normal array, in order to be compatible with how IteratorAggregate actually works.
* Doc and CS fixes.
